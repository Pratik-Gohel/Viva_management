Now Add 1 new field in Exam detail name as "Exam Name" which will be fixed in html page and i can update it anytime.
keep current value is "Winter - 2024"




Add new page name "Viva Daily Sheet" in i can download filtered data in excel format:

when saving entry of detail, I want to save new examniner detail once and want to use it repeately. so, give me one button in html page to load all examnier detail as per examiner type and branch and choose it to autofill in htmlpage along with bank detail. also, if i will use existing detail then do not add entry of that bank detail and simply bind bankDetailId with exam detail. Keep unique name while display list of exsiting bank detail like "{person name} - {Examiner Type}".

Keep in mind that, update examiner detail for selection as per branch and examiner type selection.


Display Exmainer List with unique name and examiner type. if any detail will be reapeating in list then remove that entry from list. if any detail not found of any branch or examiner type then simply display message "Detail not found". Also, keep bank detail editable. if bank detail will edit/change then update it in bank detail collection and bind with examiner detail. you can add simply icon button for make bank detail editable while autofill of examiner detail, otherwise all will be editable and bank detail edit button will not display. also, add additional logic to make for attractive to use


In Daily-sheet.html page link each field with previous field input
flow -> select exam name -> load branch available as per exam name -> load dates as per branch -> load examnier types as per dates.
